## ABSTRACT
Upskilling is essential in every walk of life. We see a lot of up-skilling applications for STEM (science, technology, engineering, and mathematics) related fields. So, we know
the functionality and benefits we stand to gain with the usage of these applications. We’d like to present similar learning opportunities for all the other fields through this
application.
The frontend of this android application will be designed using Flutter. Google Firebase will be used for the backend of the application as it provides a real-time database
and other features for building mobile apps.
We also intend to beta test this application with a few users within the target customer range to see if and how we can improvise the application to provide a better user
experience.
## Intro:
Our problem is broken down into two parts. The first is providing up-skilling opportunities to all while promoting lifelong learning opportunities and a chance at apprenticeship to mentors from their chosen field (if available).
Lifelong learning opportunities as in a chance for everyone to learn what interests them no matter their age or profession, in essence, opportunities for everyone to pursue their passion.
This is where the second part of our challenge comes in. ‘Productive employment’. We firmly believe that when people are passionate about their work they will most certainly be productive. So, when we start learning and working in our fields of interest we would be productive.
We will also provide them opportunities to exhibit and advertise their work. We hope this will help support their chances of sustaining in their chosen field.
